## 1. Input Hidden
Focused on finding hidden values in forms, such as `input` fields with the attribute `type="hidden"`. Locate and use them to complete the task.

## 2. Console Log
Use the browser's developer console (DevTools) to uncover information not directly visible on the page.

## 3. Header Request
Analyze or manipulate HTTP headers, such as adding or reading specific values during requests.

## 4. Network Chrome
Use the **Network** tab in DevTools to capture network requests. Identify specific information or responses necessary to solve the challenge.

## 5. Read Cookies
Work with cookies stored on the website. Extract values crucial for calculations or to submit the correct answer.

## 6. Simple Algo
A straightforward algorithm where you implement or understand basic logic, like calculations based on input values.

## 7. JSON Parse Prime
Work with JSON data. Load and process JSON structures, identifying specific values (e.g., prime numbers).

## 8. Picture RegExp
Use regular expressions to analyze or extract information, such as from images or other files.

## 9. Base64 QR
Decode text from Base64 or QR codes containing key information needed to solve the task.

## 10. Range Power
Perform calculations with powers or ranges. It may involve optimization or finding specific numbers.

## 11. Final Challenge
The final challenge combines multiple previous concepts (e.g., cookies, algorithms, HTTP requests). It requires deeper analysis of the code to produce a solution meeting all conditions.
