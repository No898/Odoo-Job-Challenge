# Project: Decode Password from Provided Outputs

This project demonstrates how to reconstruct a password using the outputs of a function named `r`.  
The function `r(pwd, fr, to, by)` extracts specific characters from the original password string `pwd`,  
based on given starting indices, ending indices, and step values.

## Steps Taken

1. **Output Retrieval**  
   We have multiple outputs generated by the `r` function. Each output corresponds to specific slices  
   of the hidden password `pwd`.

2. **Decryption Process**  
   To decode the original password, we place the extracted characters (from each output) into the correct  
   positions in an array. By filling these characters in their respective indices, we gradually reconstruct  
   the full password.

3. **Result Assembly**  
   After decrypting all outputs, we join the array into a single string to reveal the original password.

## Implementation Details

- A JavaScript function named `decrypt` processes each output (`text`), placing its characters into an array  
  of length 40 (`_pwd`).
- Parameters `fr`, `to`, and `by` control which positions in `_pwd` get filled with the characters from `text`.
- Repeating this step for all provided outputs populates the array with the complete password.

## Script Example

```javascript
// Create an array of length 40, initialized with empty strings
let _pwd = new Array(40).fill("");

// Decrypt function
function decrypt(text, fr, to, by) {
    // Iterate over the given range (fr to to) in steps of by
    for (let i = 0, j = fr; j < to; i++, j += by) {
        _pwd[j] = text[i];
    }
}

// Execute decryptions with the provided outputs
decrypt("885e", 0, 4, 1);
decrypt("adc3112c", 4, 20, 2);
decrypt("8c21fba1e", 5, 30, 3);
decrypt("871fdee77", 5, 40, 4);
decrypt("d1c365", 6, 40, 6);
decrypt("5", 7, 8, 1);
decrypt("312c4ed877", 10, 40, 3);
decrypt("36be65", 10, 40, 5);
decrypt("6d47e", 15, 40, 6);
decrypt("ba1e15d", 20, 40, 3);

// Join the array to get the password
let password = _pwd.join("");
console.log(password);  // This will print the decoded password
```

## How to Run

1. **Create a File**: Copy the above JavaScript code into a file named `decode.js`.
2. **Install Node.js**: Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed on your system.
3. **Run the Script**:  
   ```bash
   node decode.js
   ```
4. **View the Password**: The reconstructed password will be printed in the console.

## Output

- Once the script finishes, you will see the decoded password in your console output.
