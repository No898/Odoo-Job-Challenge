### Project: Password Extraction from element.html

First, we copied the entire element into the `element.html` file, and then we created a script to extract the password.

#### Project Steps:

1. **File Preparation:**
   - The HTML element content was copied and saved in the `element.html` file, which contained characters between `>` and `<`, along with many `#` characters or additional styling.

2. **Script Creation:**
   - We used Node.js and the `fs` library to read the file's content.
   - Regular expressions were implemented to find text between `>` and `<` while removing all `#` characters.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Each extracted character was cleaned of unwanted symbols and stored in an array.
   - The array was then merged into a single continuous text value.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The resulting string contained only the relevant characters from the HTML element and was printed to the console.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Node.js** for reading and processing the file.
- Regular expressions for extracting content between `>` and `<`.
- Text manipulation to remove unwanted characters.

#### Running the Project:
1. Ensure the `element.html` file is in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```
3. The extracted password will be printed to the console.
